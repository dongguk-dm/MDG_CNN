# Restoration of Motion Blurred Image by Modified DeblurGAN for Enhancing the Accuracies of Finger-vein Recognition

## Introduction

We proposed proposes a new method for improving the finger-vein recognition performance by restoring motion blurred finger-vein images using a modified deblur generative adversarial network (modified DeblurGAN).
