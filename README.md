# Dongguk modified DeblurGAN and CNN for recognition of blurred finger-vein image with motion blurred image database

## Introduction

We proposed a motion blurred finger-vein restoration system with modified Blind Motion Deblurring Using Conditional Adversarial Networks (modified DeblurGAN), and a finger-vein recognition system using DenseNet-161. These systems are designed to overcome the performance degradation caused by motion blur. Two open databases named as SDUMLA-HMT-DB [1] and HKPolyU-DB [2] are used for experiment. Finger-vein restoration and recognition models with motion blurred image database are opened to other researchers for fair judgement.
